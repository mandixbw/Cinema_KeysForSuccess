But by the time their visit to Greece was over, Nix had withdrawn from their friendship, and Mary had no idea why. Three years later, Nix is dead, and Mary returns to Europe to try to understand what went wrong. In the process she meets the first of many men that she will spend time with as she travels throughout the world. Through them she experiences not only a sexual awakening but a spiritual and emotional awakening that allows her to understand how the past and the future are connected and to appreciate the freedom to live life adventurously.',\n","  'popularity': 0.008,\n","  'poster_path': None,\n","  'vote_average': 0,\n","  'vote_count': 0}]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":93}]},{"metadata":{"id":"EoX_MyG0GizR","colab_type":"code","outputId":"7cd191a1-cc06-4077-a1ab-dc99b62fce3d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1540739803679,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":496,"user":{"displayName":"Santiago Rubio","photoUrl":"","userId":"15200198490239048151"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":332}},"cell_type":"code","source":["dfPeople[dfPeople.index ==6885][columnName].iloc[0][0]"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'backdrop_path': '/1Dxe2ZXesgLsbpJI5m6PyKIVk93.jpg',\n"," 'credit_id': '56e1f15e9251417896000357',\n"," 'department': 'Production',\n"," 'episode_count': 13,\n"," 'first_air_date': '2017-04-21',\n"," 'genre_ids': [35],\n"," 'id': 65856,\n"," 'job': 'Executive Producer',\n"," 'name': 'Girlboss',\n"," 'origin_country': ['US'],\n"," 'original_language': 'en',\n"," 'original_name': 'Girlboss',\n"," 'overview': 'Sophia is a rebellious, broke anarchist who refuses to grow up.
